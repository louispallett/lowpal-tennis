                    <p>It is your responsibility to play the matches by the draw deadline. Please plan early and  make every attempt to respond promptly to requests for availability. The biggest problem is  flexibility in agreeing dates for matches - so please be especially mindful of that.</p>
                    <p>It is the shared responsibility of each player to be proactive in making contact with their  opponent(s) and arranging their match by the deadline.</p>
                    <p>A court must be booked via the online court booking system.</p>
                    <p>When organising a match, create a WhatsApp group (for doubles) or directly message your  opponent (singles). Do not use shared groups (i.e. WhatsApp groups with other players such  as the ‘I want to play tennis SLTC’ chat).</p>
                    <p><i>Matches <b>cannot</b> be played on Club Nights</i>. If the only date you can play is on a club night, you can book a court in Keynsham at memorial park. Please email saltfordtourn2023@gmail.com for details.</p>
                    <p>Where a date/time for a match cannot be agreed, the Tournament Referee will make an  adjudication as to which individual/pair will receive a walkover, based on who was most  amenable to getting the match played by the original deadline.</p>
                    <p>If both parties are at fault then the winner of the match will be decided by a flip of a coin.</p>

                    <h5 className="my-1 text-lg text-center">Match Deadlines</h5>
                    <p><i>There are no extensions to deadlines.</i></p>
                    <p>The deadlines for matches may differ from category to category. A category with a large  number of players/teams (and therefore more rounds), will have a tighter deadline than  categories with fewer players/teams.</p>
                    <p>Deadlines will be made clear in updates made by the organiser and can be found on a user's 'match' page.</p>
                    <p>All players must be flexible and be prepared to play at times or days in the week which they  may not normally play.</p>
                    <p>If an injury occurs during a match, that player will have to concede. We must stress the  importance of protecting your own physical health in this instance – these tournaments are for fun, and it is better to drop out rather than risk a more serious injury.</p>
                    <p>If a player is injured or not well on the day of the match, the match can be deferred to a later date only if all players agree and if a date can be agreed before the deadline. <b>No extensions will be provided</b>. If a date cannot be agreed or found, the injured player/team forfeit the match. We understand these situations can occur and therefore it is the job of all players to be accommodating when finding an alternative date.</p>
                    <p>This should go without saying, but do not leave the match till the last minute – it is best to find the earliest date possible, since unforeseen weather may occur, and we cannot accommodate extensions.</p>
                    <p>Members can only book a week ahead online, but the tournament referee can make bookings further ahead, so do email the tournament inbox with the date and time and a  booking will be made for you which will be confirmed by an email with the gate PIN code.</p>

                    <h5 className="my-1 text-lg text-center">The Matches themselves</h5>
                    <p>All knock out matches will be the best of two full sets, with these two sets having a tie break at 6 games all to 7 points, by two clear points. The final set will be a championship tie  break to 10 points by two clear points. A third set can be a full set with a championship tie  break but only if both parties agree this when arranging the match. If one party does not want to play a full third set then the default is a championship tie break. If an agreement is made to play 3 full sets, please inform the tournament organiser 48 hours before  commencing the match and ensure you have booked enough court time so that the match can be completed on the scheduled day of the match.</p>
                    <p>The finals will be the best of three full sets with the third set tie break being a championship  tie break.</p>
                    <p>Both parties to provide balls of a good standard, except in the finals where new balls will be  provided. Please ensure you agree who is bringing balls before the match. </p>
                    <p>Please update your matches as soon as possible on the site. Any player from that match can submit the scoring.</p>
                    <p>The finals day will be <b>19th/20th October</b>. Further details will be announced nearer the time. You have all agreed by signing up that, as of the date you signed up, you are free over this  weekend. If, for whatever reason (including unforeseen circumstances, such as injury), a  finals player/pair is not available, their opponents in the semi-finals will take their place.</p>

                    <h5 className="my-1 text-lg text-center">Important Rules</h5>    
                    <p>We expect all players to abide by the Club’s ‘<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s0va9j9jt24zqkte5chb1/SLTC-Code-of-Conduct-10-April-2022.pdf?rlkey=c1rp96ws3lifcmwt0z05xak5c&e=1&dl=0" className="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400 transition-all">Code of Conduct</a>’. This tournament is about  meeting new people and playing some great tennis. Below, we have pointed out some key parts of the Code of Conduct along with some other additional rules for this tournament:</p>
                    <ol className="flex flex-col gap-2.5 list-decimal list-inside">
                        <li>Offer encouragement to others and not criticism. Especially to your partner when  playing doubles matches – there are various levels of experience in this tournament,  and it is your job to remain positive and supportive to all. A groan, sigh or negative  facial expression speaks a thousand words!</li>
                        <li>When serving, call the score at the beginning of each point throughout the game.  Call the score (in games) at the start of a new game. Call loudly enough for all players  to hear. As the serving team, it is your responsibility to do this.</li>
                        <li>When serving give the receiver sufficient time to return to position and achieve  balance. It is recommended that a player put their hand up if not ready to play.  Ensure all the players (including your own partner) are ready to play before you  serve.</li>
                        <li>Match-related communication between partners is permitted during play – i.e.  “yours”/“mine”. General conversation is not.  </li>
                        <li>Do not compliment/comment on a shot whilst a point is still being played – i.e.  “good shot”/“good serve” etc. It is fine to do this after the point is finished, but  doing so during the point could be misinterpreted as a call of ‘out’ (especially during  a serve). If you do this, and it is misinterpreted, there is a reasonable basis that you  forfeit that point.</li>
                        <li>Always clearly and loudly call a ball ‘out’ if it is out. It may be obvious to you, but  perhaps not to your opponent(s) who is/are 15-20 metres away. This call must be  made within two seconds of the ball bouncing out. It costs you nothing to make a call  even if the ball is clearly out.</li>
                        <li>The view of those closest to the ball should take priority when an ‘out’ call is made.  However, if there is a genuine dispute, a replay/let can be played. We put our trust  in you to play fairly. If this trust is broken, action will be taken.</li>
                        <li>If, during a dispute, you leave the courts for no valid reason, you forfeit the match.  This has happened before, and it is completely unacceptable. If you have a genuine  complaint, voice it politely and resolve the situation maturely.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Respect each other, be kind and friendly, and remember above all - this is about having fun!</p>
