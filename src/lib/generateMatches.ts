 * generateMatches.ts
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file exports one function:
 *      generateMatches(participants:string[]):MatchTypeLite[]
 * The participants argument must be the array of player _ids in this category ordered by RANKING.
 *
 * The aim of this function is to produce a flat array of match objects which contain the correct number of 
 * matches with the correct nextMatchIds. Each match should have exactly one nextMatchId, except for the final,
 * whose nextMatchId is null. This is very similar to a binary tree, but in reverse. In the case of 8 players, 
 * we want the matches to look like this:
 *
 * 
 *  QF ---v
 *        SF ----
 *  QF ---^     v 
 *              Final
 *  QF ---v     ^
 *        SF ----
 *  QF ---^
 *
 * --- Assigning Players ---
 *  >Case: players.length is a power of 2<
 *  If players is a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.), this is incredibly easy. First, we need to split our 
 *  match array into a multidimensional array of four matches each - we do this through the splitIntoFours() 
 *  function:
 *   [number denotes array.length]
 *   [4] => [[4]]
 *   [8] => [[4], [4]]
 *   [16] =>[[4], [4], [4], [4]]
 *   ... and so on
 *  We then run the result through reorderArray() - this selects matches based on the order array of indexes:
 *  [0, 3, 2, 1] - so:
 *   [1a, 1b, 1c, 1d] [2a, 2b, 2c, 2d]
 *   becomes...
 *   [1a, 2a, 1d, 2d, 1c, 2c, 1b, 2b]
 *  Note, if only a single array exists in this multidimensional array, this array is just flattened and returned.
 *
 *  The order of these matches in the result of reorderArray() denotes to the order we can add participants 
 *  sequentially (in order to ensure top-ranking players cannot play each other until the end)
 *  
 *  So, we just remove the top and bottom player from our player array and add them to the matches 
 *  in order.
 *  
 *  //! Note, this final step is actually different because this function is universal for all player.length values.
 *  //! However, if we were ONLY working with ^2 players, this is how we could do it.
 *  
 *  Now, we just return the arrays flattened()!
 *
 *  >Case: players.length is NOT a power of 2<
 *  It is far more likely that the number of players will not be a power of two. For each player over the nearest 
 *  ^2 (floored), we add one qualifying match. So, if there are 9 players, that's one qualifying match. Qualifying 
 *  matches must ALWAYS have two players in them, since there are no preceeding matches.
 *
 *  This case works the same in generateMatches() up until the second for loop.
 *
 *  //? NOTE: We need to account for both a single qualifying match scenario (where the number of qualifying matches
 *  //? is no more than the number of matches in the next round), but also a double match scenario (where the 
 *  //? number of qualifying matches is more than the number of matches in the next round, but less than the next 
 *  //? ^2
 *
 *  This is where our matchesOrdered variable (result of reorderArray()) is very handy. Note that earlier in the 
 *  function we create a variable called:
 *      qualifyingPlayers
 *  This calculates the number of players needed for the qualifyingMatches (which is the number of matches * 2, since
 *  all qualifying matches must have exactly 2 players each). This leaves the participants array with the remaining
 *  players who are in this firstRound (the first non-qualifying round) - also known as our byes.
 *
 *  Now, we can loop through the matchesOrdered array in a very special way - from top to bottom, and then from 
 *  bottom to top again, using this little piece of maths:
 *      const index = i < n ? i : 2 * n - i - 1;
 *      matchesOrdered[index] //? This is what we use it for
 *  //? Note - this is how we allocate players even in a ^2 case, this works the same as the previous method, but 
 *  //? it also works for this !^2 case, to make the code universal.
 *  This means we then add the qualifyingPlayers sequentially to the firstRound matches. This means the top player 
 *  is allocated to first item, the second to the next one, and so on. However, remember that because matchesOrdered
 *  is a clever order which means that the second player is actually on the other side of the bracket (since the 
 *  original index was the final subarray).
 *
 *  Ok, NOW we create our qualifying matches! We again use matchesOrdered and that clever indexing system previously
 *  mentioned:
 *      const index = i < n ? i : 2 * n - i - 1;
 *  Now we loop through the qualifying match number (REMAINING participants.length / 2), create a qualifying match,
 *  assigning it's nextMatchId to matchesOrdered[index]._id and assigning the previousMatchId to 
 *  matchesOrdered[index] using the nullish coelecing operator:
 *      (matchesOrdered[index.previousMatchId ??= []).push(match._id)
 *  Because of our fancy index technique, the first match to have a previousMatchId is at matchesOrdered[0] and the 
 *  last match to have one is ALSO matchesOrdered[0].
 *
 *  Then, finally, we add our remaining participants to the qualifying matches through these loops:
 *
 *   for (const match of qualifyingMatches) {
 *       match.participants.push(participants.pop());
 *   }
 *   
 *   for (const match of qualifyingMatches.reverse()) {
 *       match.participants.push(participants.shift());
 *   }
 * 
 * These loops loop from the top to the bottom and back again (like our fancy indexing), but this code is much 
 * simplier, so we just run it through two loops.
 * 
 * FINALLY, collate everything together in one result array and return it:
 * 
 *   const result = [...matches.flat(), ...matchesOrdered, ...qualifyingMatches];
 *   return result;
