            <p>Players can select whether they are seeded when they join the tournament. However, as the host, you can edit which players are seeded.</p>
            <h5>Why is seeding important?</h5>
            <p>
                Seeding is used when creating teams for doubles categories. When teams are created, seeded players and non-seeded players are divided into 
                separate groups. Both groups are then shuffled and each seeded player is matched with a non-seeded player until there are no seeded players 
                left. Then, the remaining non-seeded players are matched together.
            </p>
            <p>This ensures that two seeded players are not matched together.</p>
            <p>
                The function for creating teams also handles cases where the number of seeded players is greater than the number of non-seeded players. 
                Although... to be honest, if that's the case, you should be thinking about 'un-seeding' some players! If this is the case, it's inevitable that
                some seeded players will be matched together, which is why it isn't ideal.
            </p>
            <p>If you don't want seeding and want team creation to be completely random, just make sure no players are seeded.</p>
